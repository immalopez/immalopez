Surrounded by books since birth, I developed a strong interest in both language and literature from a very young age, a passion that I have been nurturing consistently through an exhaustive study. In addition to learning English, Russian, Korean and Chinese, I graduated with honors from the University of Barcelona in Literary Theory and Comparative Literature, and I have worked for the National Theatre of Catalonia as a literary translator. My goal right now is to become a Spanish teacher and travel the world.
